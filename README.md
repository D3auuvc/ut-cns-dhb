# Decoding the Human Brain
Predict visual stimuli from MEG recordings of human brain activity

## Initial Plan
What data will you be using? The data will be source from the project site [1], which contains 9,414 MEG recordings from 16 subjects (face image or scramble image as stimulus), and containing test set comprises 4058 MEG recordings from 7 subjects without class labels.
	
What methods you plan to use?  We will try to use autoencoder model to see if the result encoding from those MEG signal will accurately predict what stimulus is presented to object. (Very high level - i.e we will use recurrent networks or â€œwe will do something like this article)
